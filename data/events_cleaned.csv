2023,"Pitch Clock Implementation: A standardized period of 30 seconds between batters within each half-inning. A timer between pitches of 15 seconds with the bases empty, and 20 seconds with at least one runner on base. The pitcher must start his motion before the expiration of the pitch timer. A violation will result in an automatic ball. The batter must be in the box and alert to the pitcher with no less than eight seconds remaining. A violation will result in an automatic strike. With runners on base, the timer resets if the pitcher attempts a pickoff or steps off the rubber (collectively called a ""disengagement""). Only two disengagements are allowed per plate appearance; however, this count resets if a baserunner advances. Mound visits, injury timeouts, and offensive team timeouts do not count against this. On a third disengagement, an unsuccessful pickoff attempt will cause that runner to advance one base. If a team has used up all of its allowed five mound visits by the ninth inning, it receives an extra visit in the ninth. Umpires can provide extra time if circumstances warrant."

All infielders must have both feet on or inside the outer edge of the marked infield while the pitcher is on the rubber. Infielders cannot switch sides of the infield before a pitch is released.
